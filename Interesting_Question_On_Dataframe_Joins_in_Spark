The below code block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new DataFrame that
is the result of an inner join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on
column storeId and column employeeId which are in both DataFrames. Identify the error.
Code block:
storesDF.join(employeesDF, [col("storeId"), col("employeeId")])


A. The join() operation is a standalone function rather than a method of DataFrame — the
join() operation should be called where its first two arguments are storesDF and
employeesDF.
B. There must be a third argument to join() because the default to the how parameter is not
"inner".
C. The col("storeId") and col("employeeId") arguments should not be separate
elements of a list — they should be tested to see if they're equal to one another like
col("storeId") == col("employeeId").
D. There is no DataFrame.join() operation — DataFrame.merge() should be used
instead.
E. The references to "storeId" and "employeeId" should not be inside the col()
function — removing the col() function should result in a successful join.
