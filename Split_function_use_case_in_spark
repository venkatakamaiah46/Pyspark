The code block shown below contains an error. The code block intends to return a new DataFrame
where column storeCategory from DataFrame storesDF is split at the underscore character
into column storeValueCategory and column storeSizeCategory. Identify the error.
A sample of DataFrame storesDF is displayed below:
Code block:
(storesDF.withColumn(
"storeValueCategory", col("storeCategory").split("_")[0]
).withColumn(
"storeSizeCategory", col("storeCategory").split("_")[1]
)
)
A. The split() operation comes from the imported functions object. It accepts a string
column name and split character as arguments. It is not a method of a Column object.
B. The split() operation comes from the imported functions object. It accepts a Column
object and split character as arguments. It is not a method of a Column object.
C. The index values of 0 and 1 should be provided as second arguments to the split()
operation rather than indexing the result.
D. The index values of 0 and 1 are not correct â€” they should be 1 and 2, respectively.
E. The withColumn() operation cannot be called twice in a row.
